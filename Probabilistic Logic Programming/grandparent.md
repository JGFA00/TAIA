## Explanation
This solution defines the `grandparent/2` relationship using Aleph by providing:
- **Background knowledge** (`family1.b`): Facts about family relationships and declarations for Aleph to understand the `grandparent` structure.
- **Positive examples** (`family1.f`): Cases where the `grandparent/2` relationship holds.
- **Negative examples** (`family1.n`): Cases where the `grandparent/2` relationship does not hold, helping Aleph to generalize the relationship accurately.

## Background Knowledge (`family1.b`)

This section defines Aleph's mode declarations for `grandparent/2` and provides family facts for `father/2` and `mother/2`. These facts enable Aleph to induce the definition of `grandparent/2` using existing parent relationships.

```prolog
% Background knowledge about family relationships
:- modeh(*, grandparent(+person, -person)).
:- modeb(*, parent(+person, -person)).

% Facts about parent relationships
father(john, mary).
mother(ann, mary).
father(mary, susan).
mother(mary, james).
```

## Positive Examples (`family1.f`)

These examples define cases where one person is indeed the grandparent of another. Aleph uses these to learn what constitutes a `grandparent/2` relationship.

```prolog
% Positive examples for grandparent/2
grandparent(john, susan).
grandparent(john, james).
grandparent(ann, susan).
grandparent(ann, james).
```

## Negative Examples (`family1.n`)

These examples define cases where the `grandparent/2` relationship does not apply. This helps Aleph avoid false positives when inducing the hypothesis.

```prolog
% Negative examples for grandparent/2
grandparent(john, mary).
grandparent(ann, mary).
grandparent(susan, john).
grandparent(james, ann).
```

This combined solution document provides everything Aleph needs to infer a correct rule for `grandparent/2`. After loading these definitions into Aleph, you should be able to induce a rule resembling:

```prolog
grandparent(A, B) :- parent(A, C), parent(C, B).
```

This result indicates that a grandparent relationship exists if `A` is the parent of `C` and `C` is the parent of `B`.
